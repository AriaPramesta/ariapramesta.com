            <p>I had time to learn several things to increase my knowledge, I learned a few things since I graduated from high school, and these are some things that I can understand.</p>
            <p>I have learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL Database. in HTML I learned the basics of creating websites and I also learned about HTML Forms. in CSS I learned about basic CSS, Layouting, and Flexbox, so I know how to make websites more attractive. in JavaScript I learned the basics of making websites more dynamic and interactive</p>
        </div>

        <p>There are some things that I have studied too, such as GO, JSON, and several other things, but I will re-study the things that I have learned so that I can understand them well, I will continue to add to the knowledge that I have and deepen it</p>
