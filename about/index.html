            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a student who has just graduated from high school in 2023. I have started learning about programming since I was still in high school, and now I want to focus more on learning about programming and other things by joining the Bearmentor Bootcamp.</p>
            <p>I've learned the basics of web development, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through learning videos on social media, so I know the basics of creating a website, but that's not enough for me, I will continue to improve my skills and learn many things.</p>
            <p>This is the first personal website I created, I was 18 years old when I created this website, there's not much I can fill in here, but I will continue to update this website in the future, such as the projects I will work on and what I can do.</p>
